# Fishybot ESO
Auto fishing bot for Elder Scrolls Online. The Bot automatically fishes until the fishing hole disappears.  It can also send a notification to the users phone with the statistics of that fishing hole.

Don't forget to star this repository if you really liked it :)

### FAQs
Will I get baned using this bot?

> Botting does violate ESO's terms of service, so technically you could get banned. But this bot doesn't read or write memory from ESO so they won't know you are using a bot. **This software doesn't come with any Liability or Warranty, I am not responsible if you do get banned.**

How much automation does this bot provide?

> It's not a fully automated bot, it does fishing on its own but you will have to move from one hole to another manually (although I was developing a fully automated bot, I didn't get a positive feedback from the community so I discontinued it).

Bot doesn't work in full screen.

> Check the full screen box.

The bot catches the fish but doesn't press R to collect it

> Check the Collect R checkbox
